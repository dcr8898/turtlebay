# _Turtle Bay_

## Summary
A clone of ebay built as a learning exercise.  The goal was to create the app in Ruby on Rails, then duplicate it exactly in PHP (using Laravel) and Python (Django).

_Turtle Bay_ is a project by:
* [Heather Lorenzo](https://github.com/jeder28), and
* [Damian Rossney](https://github.com/dcr8898).

##Development
We utilized a streamlined agile process based on the Kanban system.  To ensure proper git hygiene, we utilized the [Steven G. Harms Enhanced Rebase Optimized Team Enabled Git Workflow(tm)](https://github.com/nyc-mud-turtles-2015/phase-2-guide/blob/nyc/resources/git_workflow.md).
